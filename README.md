# Customer-segmentation-based-on-RFM-analysis
So as a marketer, I want to focus on high RFM groups, but before I focus on these groups, I have
to identify them first. And this is where RFM and K means in this section also will help me do so.

RFM analysis can be done in two ways.

The first way is a statistical way where we segment each metric into three parts or three groups and
then we create a multi group.

So for example one, two, three is a frequency is a recency customer who just bought the frequency
is not so high.
That's why it's two and three will be the value and it's very low. So these are the attributes of the customer.
There can be a three, two, one and so on.
And we can calculate this statistically, and this is the first part.
The second part we will calculate it using K means and K means is a machine learning algorithm where it clusters the similar customers in similar in groups.
So the similar customers will, let's say, be attracted to each other in a cluster.
And here there are some questions we have to address, such as how many clusters we should initiate
or how many groups of customers we should initiate. And we will also tackle that in the section using the elbow spray and also something called the silhouette
score.So there is a lot of rich ways that we can segment the customer and we will find it in this code.
